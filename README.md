# qlive
Repository to prototype apps using shinylive and quarto-live

I wrote ocde to show the congruence of statistics generated by either built-in or linear model functions in R as outlined in the [cheatsheet by tests-as-linear on Github](https://github.com/lindeloev/tests-as-linear).

By going through the [{shinylive} documentation](https://github.com/posit-dev/r-shinylive), I installed `{shinylive}` and followed the instructions below:

```r
install.packages("shinylive")
shinylive::export(".", "site") # Took about 20 seconds
httpuv::runStaticServer("site")
```

Oh wow, the `site/` directory for this small app is almost 100MB!

As outlined in [an example](https://github.com/wch/shinylive-example) by Winston at Posit, I'm going to use github actions to deploy this to Github Pages. After some modification I settled on the workflow in this repository.

You can view the final deployed app at [https://ngiangre.github.io/qlive/](https://ngiangre.github.io/qlive/). It takes a few minutes to load on mobile but a little bit less time on the web browser. But the bright side is everything is contained in the browser - no server! The drawback of longer loading time can be offset if it is known there would be alot of concurrent traffic that would normally freeze up shiny server sessions.
